Introduction
	The prototype had two majour purposes. The first was to identify

	privacy concerns by making it accessible
	adhering to HCI standards.

Methods

Survey

Focus Group

Paper Prototyping

Procedure

Fittzlaw

Results

	Survey - Reference
	Differences between the two surveys should be noted

	Hiding content and making a register page behind the login page proved to be useful

Discussion
	important findings - 

Conclusions

Privacy options that can be accessed with no to minimal css/js proved to be useful in supporting multiple browsers and slow connections.

The use of single button privacy settings will not eradicate the time needed to configure privacy settings but makes minor changes simple.

Alternating Buttons are effective in decreasing the complexity of privacy settings, however deeper compexity is needed for larger groups to initially configure a group.

Provided some confirmation for our earlier work that suggested a default privacy setting option should be established. Further work is required before the optimal solution can be found.
